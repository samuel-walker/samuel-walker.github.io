## Hello!

I am an ABD PhD Candidate in [Human Geography at the University of Toronto](http://geography.utoronto.ca/) with [Dr. Sarah Wakefield](geography.utoronto.ca/profiles/sarah-wakefield/) as my supervisor. I am an urban and environmental geographer with specializations in urban sustainability governance, environmental and food justice, and community development and organizing. I am also a strong proponent of multimethod research in human geography, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods including GIS.
